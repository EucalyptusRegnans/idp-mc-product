\*   \*\*Project Name:\*\* MHE-MT v6 Prototype Validation  
\*   \*\*Master Plan Version:\*\* v1.0 Draft 1  
\*   \*\*Approval Context:\*\* This Master Plan, once finalized and approved by the Human User, will guide the PBE-managed development of the MHE-MT v6 Prototype. Specific approval dates are managed externally by the Human User.  
\*   \*\*Record Generation Context:\*\* This record was generated by Planner-AI based on existing project documentation and collaborative discussion with the Human User. Specific generation dates are managed externally by the Human User via file system/version control.

\#\# 2\. Executive Summary  
This Master Plan outlines the strategy and execution steps for the "MHE-MT v6 Prototype Validation" project. The primary goal is to implement and rigorously validate core multi-tenant architectural patterns chosen for the larger IDP-MC System. This includes validating an Implicit Tenant Context Propagation strategy (using \`nestjs-cls\` and a Prisma Client Extension for \`SET LOCAL\`), alongside Explicit Application-Level Filtering, and Row-Level Security (RLS) as an active defense-in-depth layer. The project will also validate basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role association and an asynchronous task pattern (BullMQ) with correct tenant context propagation. Successful completion of this prototype is critical for de-risking these complex patterns before full-scale IDP-MC Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development. The project leverages existing detailed plans and aims for a high-quality, robust, and secure implementation.

\#\# 3\. Core Project Mission & Objectives  
\#\#\# 3.1. Mission Statement

\#\# 4\. Overall Project Scope  
\#\#\# 4.1. In Scope  
\*   Refactoring the MHE v1 backend codebase into a NestJS modular monolith structure.  
\*   Implementing the multi-tenant database schema as defined in "IDP-MC Technical Specification v2.2" and "MHE MT Project Plan & High-Level Design (v6 \- FINAL DRAFT).md" (including \`Organization\`, \`User\`, \`Membership\`, \`Role\`, \`Permission\`, \`RolePermission\`, \`MembershipRole\` tables, and modifications to the \`Habit\` table).  
\*   Implementing the \`nestjs-cls\` library for implicit tenant context storage.  
\*   Implementing a Prisma Client Extension to retrieve context from \`nestjs-cls\` and execute \`SET LOCAL\` commands for RLS context.  
\*   Implementing explicit \`WHERE organization\_id\` filters in application services (e.g., \`HabitService\`) using context retrieved from \`nestjs-cls\`.  
\*   Implementing basic RLS policies for tenant isolation on key tenant-scoped tables (e.g., the \`Habit\` table).  
\*   Implementing a simple BullMQ asynchronous job (e.g., for logging habit creation) demonstrating correct tenant context propagation to and within the worker.  
\*   Creating seed data for multiple tenants and users, linking to pre-existing Supabase Auth user UUIDs provided by the Human User.  
\*   Rigorous automated testing (unit, integration, RLS-specific, context-propagation-specific) of the implemented multi-tenancy and asynchronous processing patterns.  
\*   Manual validation of the core multi-tenant scenario, including negative cases.  
\*   A dedicated security review of the implemented multi-tenancy mechanisms, facilitated by Deep Research AI.  
\*   Generation of all PBE artifacts for the MHE-MT v6 project.

\#\#\# 4.2. Out of Scope  
\*   Development of full IDP-MC application features beyond those necessary to validate the core MHE-MT v6 scenario (e.g., only minimal \`Habit\` entity functionality will be adapted).  
\*   Complex User Interface (UI) changes to the MHE v1 frontend beyond what is absolutely minimal for testing the backend multi-tenancy functionality.  
\*   Detailed Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permission logic beyond basic role association necessary for context validation.

\*   Advanced offline synchronization capabilities for the PWA.  
\*   Advanced caching strategies.  
\*   Cloud deployment of the MHE-MT v6 prototype (local Docker-based validation is sufficient).  
\*   Implementation of Model Context Protocol (MCP) features.

\#\# 5\. Strategic Approach & Methodology  
The project will be executed using the Planner-Builder-Expert (PBE) framework, Version 1.0. Development will be iterative, following the Stages and Steps outlined in this Master Plan. Existing detailed plans for MHE-MT v6 will be leveraged as the primary source for technical implementation details within Builder Work-packages. The Human User will provide strategic oversight, approvals, and facilitate AI interactions (Builder-AI, Deep Research AI). Emphasis will be placed on rigorous testing and validation at each step, culminating in a dedicated security review. AI assistance (facilitated by the Human User) will be heavily utilized for development tasks, adhering to the architectural patterns defined in "IDP-MC System \- Technical Specification v2.2."

The respective modules (\`ClsModule\`, \`BullModule\`) were configured within the new \`CoreModule\`.\\n\* \*\*Docker Environment Updated:\*\* The project's \`docker-compose.yml\` was updated to remove the old services and introduce new services for the consolidated \`backend\` and a local \`postgres:15\` database and \`redis\` instance.\\n\* \*\*Database Schema Defined & Migrated:\*\* The \`prisma/schema.prisma\` file was updated with the full multi-tenant schema, including \`Organization\`, \`User\`, \`Membership\`, \`Role\`, and \`Permission\` models, and the \`Habit\` model was updated accordingly.\\n\* \*\*Database Seeded:\*\* A \`prisma/seed.ts\` script was created and successfully run to populate the new tables with initial data.\\n\* \*\*Migration Applied:\*\* After resolving several environmental and data-related issues, \`prisma migrate\` was run successfully to apply the new schema to the local database.\\n\* \*\*Initial Test Run Confirmed:\*\* After resolving a series of complex build and runtime errors, the final \`docker compose up \--build\` command resulted in a successful build and a clean startup of all services, confirming the successful completion of all tasks.",  
    "finalStateDescription": "The project is now in a stable and verified state. The \`backend\` directory contains a fully consolidated and modularized NestJS application.

\#\#\# \*\*Step 2.1 (v9) \- Hardened Authorization Flow: Implementation Instructions\*\*

\*\*1. Goal\*\*  
To implement a production-grade, secure, and maintainable multi-tenant authorization flow. This involves creating a \`TenantGuard\` that validates a user's membership in a specified organization and populates a trusted, request-scoped context using \`nestjs-cls\`. The logic will be decoupled into a \`MembershipService\` for clean, testable data access.

\*\*2. Prerequisites\*\*  
\*   The project is in the state of having successfully completed "Step 1 \- FBI (Foundational Blueprint Implementation)".  
\*   The \`nestjs-cls\` module is configured and available globally.  
\*   The \`TenantPrismaService\` is available globally and provides automated tenant filtering.

\*\*3. Implementation Steps\*\*

\*\*Part A: Create Core Authorization Components\*\*

\*\*Step 3.1: Create Typed CLS Store Interface\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* If it doesn't already exist from a previous step's finalization, create \`backend/src/common/interfaces/cls-store.interface.ts\`.  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\*  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { ClsStore } from 'nestjs-cls';

    export interface IClsStore extends ClsStore {  
      userId: string;  
      organizationId: string;  
      roles: string\[\];  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.2: Create \`MembershipService\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a new module directory \`backend/src/membership\` and create the service file.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/membership  
    gedit backend/src/membership/membership.service.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\* This service will encapsulate the database logic for checking tenancy.  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';  
    import { TenantPrismaService } from '../database/tenant-prisma.service';

    export interface ActiveMembership {  
      organizationId: string;  
      roles: string\[\];  
    }

    @Injectable()  
    export class MembershipService {  
      private get prisma() {  
        return this.tenantPrisma.client;  
      }  
      constructor(private readonly tenantPrisma: TenantPrismaService) {}

      async findActiveMembership(  
        userId: string,  
        organizationId: string,  
      ): Promise\<ActiveMembership | null\> {  
        // We use the base un-extended client for this specific check, as we are validating  
        // access \*before\* the tenant context is set. This is a special case.  
        // A more advanced pattern could use the tenanted client but with a bypass flag.  
        // For clarity, we will assume a base \`PrismaService\` is also available for this.  
        // Let's refine this to use the tenanted client, but its filter won't apply here  
        // because the \`organizationId\` is not yet in the CLS store.  
        const membership \= await this.prisma.membership.findFirst({  
          where: {  
            userId,  
            organizationId,  
            // A status field would be ideal here, e.g., status: 'ACTIVE'  
          },  
          include: {  
            roles: {  
              include: {  
                role: {  
                  select: {  
                    name: true,  
                  },  
                },  
              },  
            },  
          },  
        });

        if (\!membership) {  
          return null;  
        }

        const roles \= membership.roles.map((mr) \=\> mr.role.name);

        return {  
          organizationId: membership.organizationId,  
          roles,  
        };  
      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.3: Create \`MembershipModule\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create the module file to provide the service.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/membership/membership.module.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\*  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';  
    import { MembershipService } from './membership.service';

    @Module({  
      providers: \[MembershipService\],  
      exports: \[MembershipService\],  
    })  
    export class MembershipModule {}  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Part B: Implement and Apply the Tenant Guard\*\*

\*\*Step 3.4: Create the \`@Public\` Decorator\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a decorator to mark routes that should bypass our global guard.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/auth/decorators  
    gedit backend/src/auth/decorators/public.decorator.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\*  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

    export const IS\_PUBLIC\_KEY \= 'isPublic';  
    export const Public \= () \=\> SetMetadata(IS\_PUBLIC\_KEY, true);  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.5: Create the \`TenantGuard\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* This is the core security gate. Create the guard file.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/auth/guards  
    gedit backend/src/auth/guards/tenant.guard.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\* This guard validates the \`X-Organization-ID\` header, checks membership, and populates the CLS store.  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import {  
      Injectable,  
      CanActivate,  
      ExecutionContext,  
      BadRequestException,  
      ForbiddenException,  
      UnauthorizedException,  
    } from '@nestjs/common';  
    import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';  
    import { ClsService } from 'nestjs-cls';  
    import { MembershipService } from '../../membership/membership.service';  
    import { IClsStore } from '../../common/interfaces/cls-store.interface';  
    import { IS\_PUBLIC\_KEY } from '../decorators/public.decorator';

    @Injectable()  
    export class TenantGuard implements CanActivate {  
      constructor(  
        private readonly reflector: Reflector,  
        private readonly cls: ClsService\<IClsStore\>,  
        private readonly membershipService: MembershipService,  
      ) {}

      async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise\<boolean\> {  
        const isPublic \= this.reflector.getAllAndOverride\<boolean\>(IS\_PUBLIC\_KEY, \[  
          context.getHandler(),  
          context.getClass(),  
        \]);  
        if (isPublic) {  
          return true;  
        }

        const request \= context.switchToHttp().getRequest();  
        const userId \= this.cls.get('userId');  
        if (\!userId) {  
          throw new UnauthorizedException('User authentication context (userId) not found.');  
        }

        const organizationId \= request.headers\['x-organization-id'\];  
        if (\!organizationId || typeof organizationId \!== 'string') {  
          throw new BadRequestException('X-Organization-ID header is required.');  
        }

        const membership \= await this.membershipService.findActiveMembership(  
          userId,  
          organizationId,  
        );

        if (\!membership) {  
          throw new ForbiddenException('Access denied to the specified organization.');  
        }

        this.cls.set('organizationId', membership.organizationId);  
        this.cls.set('roles', membership.roles);

        return true;  
      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.6: Apply the Guard Globally\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* We will register the \`TenantGuard\` as a global guard in \`app.module.ts\`. This ensures it runs on every request.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* Open \`backend/src/app.module.ts\`  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/app.module.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Modify the file to import and provide the new components.  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    // At top of file  
    import { APP\_GUARD } from '@nestjs/core';  
    import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';  
    import { MembershipModule } from './membership/membership.module';  
    import { TenantGuard } from './auth/guards/tenant.guard';

    // ... inside the @Module decorator  
    imports: \[  
      // ... other modules  
      AuthModule,  
      MembershipModule,  
    \],  
    providers: \[  
      {  
        provide: APP\_GUARD,  
        useClass: TenantGuard,  
      },  
    \],  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Part C: Integrate with Upstream Authentication\*\*

\*\*Step 3.7: Create an \`AuthGuard\` to Populate \`userId\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* The \`TenantGuard\` relies on \`userId\` being in the CLS store. We need an upstream guard to handle JWT validation and populate it.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* Create \`backend/src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts\`.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\* This guard will validate the JWT and set the \`userId\`.  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { Injectable, ExecutionContext, UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';  
    import { AuthGuard as PassportAuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';  
    import { ClsService } from 'nestjs-cls';  
    import { IClsStore } from '../../common/interfaces/cls-store.interface';

    @Injectable()  
    export class JwtAuthGuard extends PassportAuthGuard('jwt') {  
      constructor(private readonly cls: ClsService\<IClsStore\>) {  
        super();  
      }

      // This method is called by the Passport strategy after it validates the token.  
      // The \`user\` object is what our JwtStrategy's \`validate\` method returns.  
      handleRequest(err, user, info, context: ExecutionContext) {  
        if (err || \!user) {  
          throw err || new UnauthorizedException();  
        }

        // \--- THIS IS THE KEY STEP \---  
        // Populate the CLS store with the authenticated user's ID.  
        this.cls.set('userId', user.userId);

        return user;  
      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.8: Apply Both Guards Globally in the Correct Order\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* NestJS applies global guards in the order they are provided. The \`JwtAuthGuard\` must run \*before\* the \`TenantGuard\`.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* Update \`backend/src/app.module.ts\` one last time.  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/app.module.ts  
    \`\`\`  
\*   Update the \`providers\` array to have both guards in the correct order.  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    // ... inside the @Module decorator  
    providers: \[  
      {  
        provide: APP\_GUARD,  
        useClass: JwtAuthGuard, // Runs FIRST  
      },  
      {  
        provide: APP\_GUARD,  
        useClass: TenantGuard, // Runs SECOND  
      },  
    \],  
    \`\`\`  
    Also, ensure \`AuthModule\` and \`MembershipModule\` are correctly imported.

\*\*4. Final Validation\*\*  
\*   Run the E2E test suite you will develop based on the testing strategy from the DR AI reports.  
\*   Create a test endpoint protected by these guards.  
\*   \*\*Test Case 1 (Success):\*\* Send a request with a valid JWT and a valid \`X-Organization-ID\` header. The request should succeed.  
\*   \*\*Test Case 2 (Failure \- No Tenant):\*\* Send a request with a valid JWT but an \`X-Organization-ID\` for an organization the user is not a member of. The request should fail with a \`403 Forbidden\` error.  
\*   \*\*Test Case 3 (Failure \- No Auth):\*\* Send a request with an invalid JWT. The request should fail with a \`401 Unauthorized\` error.

\#\#\# \*\*Step 2.2 (v1.0) \- Implement Transaction-Aware RLS Activation: Implementation Instructions\*\*

\*\*1. Goal\*\*  
To implement the definitive, transaction-aware Prisma Client Extension that automatically sets RLS session variables (\`rls.user\_id\` and \`rls.organization\_id\`) before every query. This solution is designed to be secure, performant, and fully compatible with the \`@nestjs-cls/transactional\` library.

\*\*2. Prerequisites\*\*  
\*   The project must be in the state following the successful completion and merge of "Step 2.1 (v9) \- Hardened Authorization Flow."  
\*   The \`feature/mhe-mt-v6\` branch is up-to-date locally.  
\*   A new feature branch, \`feature/step-2.2-rls-activation\`, has been created and checked out.

\*\*3. Implementation Steps\*\*

\*\*Part A: Create Foundational RLS Components\*\*

\*\*Step 3.1: Update the \`IClsStore\` Interface\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Add the \`roles\` property back to our CLS store interface. We removed this during a previous fix, but the \`TenantGuard\` from Step 2.1 correctly adds it, so the interface must match.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/common/interfaces/cls-store.interface.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Ensure the file content is:  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { ClsStore } from 'nestjs-cls';

    export interface IClsStore extends ClsStore {  
      userId: string;  
      organizationId: string;  
      roles: string\[\];  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.2: Create RLS-Specific Context and Error Files\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a dedicated directory and file for our RLS-specific types and custom error. This improves organization.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/common/rls  
    gedit backend/src/common/rls/rls.interfaces.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Paste the following content:  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { ClsStore } from 'nestjs-cls';

    // This re-exports our main CLS store interface for use within the RLS context  
    export type RlsClsStore \= ClsStore & {  
      userId?: string;  
      organizationId?: string;  
    };

    // The custom error that will be thrown if context is missing  
    export class MissingRlsContextError extends Error {  
      constructor(missingKey: 'userId' | 'organizationId' | 'both') {  
        super(  
          \`Execution aborted due to missing RLS context. The key "${missingKey}" was not found in the CLS store.\`,  
        );  
        this.name \= 'MissingRlsContextError';  
      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Part B: Implement the Transaction-Aware Prisma Extension\*\*

\*\*Step 3.3: Create the \`rls-prisma.extension.ts\` File\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create the file that will contain the core logic for our transaction-aware Prisma Client Extension.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/prisma/extensions

    } from '@nestjs-cls/transactional-adapter-prisma';  
    import { MissingRlsContextError, RlsClsStore } from '../../common/rls/rls.interfaces';

    export const createRlsExtension \= (

                const setRlsVariablesQuery \= Prisma.sql\`SELECT set\_config('rls.user\_id', ${userId}, true), set\_config('rls.organization\_id', ${organizationId}, true);\`;

                if (txHost.isTransactionActive()) {  
                  const tx \= txHost.tx as PrismaClient;  
                  await tx.$executeRaw(setRlsVariablesQuery);  
                  return query(args);  
                } else {  
                  const \[, result\] \= await prisma.$transaction(\[

                  \]);  
                  return result;

    \`\`\`

\*\*Part C: Integrate the Extension into NestJS\*\*

\*\*Step 3.4: Create the RLS Prisma Provider\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a NestJS Factory Provider that will construct our extended Prisma client and make it available for dependency injection.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    mkdir \-p backend/src/prisma/providers  
    gedit backend/src/prisma/providers/rls-prisma.provider.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Paste the following content:

    import { createRlsExtension } from '../extensions/rls-prisma.extension';  
    import { RlsClsStore } from '../../common/rls/rls.interfaces';

    export const RLS\_PRISMA\_CLIENT \= Symbol('RLS\_PRISMA\_CLIENT');  
      
    export type RlsPrismaClient \= ReturnType\<typeof createRlsExtension\>;

    export const RlsPrismaProvider: Provider \= {

        return prisma.$extends(extension);  
      },  
    };  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.5: Create the \`RlsPrismaModule\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a dedicated module to encapsulate and export our new RLS-aware client provider.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/prisma/rls-prisma.module.ts

    export class RlsPrismaModule {}  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.6: Update \`AppModule\` to use the New Modules and Configure Transactional Plugin\*\*

        if (\!membership) return null;

        const roles \= membership.roles.map((mr) \=\> mr.role.name);

        return { organizationId: membership.organizationId, roles };  
      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`

\*\*4. Final Validation\*\*  
\*   Run the application with \`docker compose up \--build \-d\`.  
\*   Verify that the application starts successfully without any dependency injection errors.  
\*   Perform a manual test using a tool like Postman or Insomnia:  
    1\.  Create a user and organization directly in your Supabase DB.  
    2\.  Send a request to a protected endpoint (e.g., \`POST /habits\`) with a valid JWT for that user and the correct \`X-Organization-ID\` header.  
    3\.  The request should succeed.  
    4\.  Send the same request with an incorrect \`X-Organization-ID\`. The request should fail with a \`403 Forbidden\` error from the \`TenantGuard\`.

\#\#\# \*\*Step 2.2a \- Foundation Hardening: Implementation Instructions\*\*

\*\*1. Goal\*\*  
To perform a comprehensive refactoring and hardening of the existing MHE-MT v6 foundation by implementing the definitive solutions identified in our "Full System Integrity Audit." This will address critical issues in infrastructure, database performance, data access security, and application architecture.

\*\*2. Prerequisites\*\*  
\*   The project is in the state following the successful completion and merge of Step 2.2.  
\*   Your local \`feature/mhe-mt-v6\` branch is up-to-date.  
\*   The Supabase local development stack is running (\`npx supabase start\`).

\*\*3. Implementation Steps\*\*

\*\*Part A: Create Feature Branch & Install Dependencies\*\*

\*\*Step 3.1: Create the New Feature Branch\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Before making any changes, create and switch to a new feature branch for this hardening step.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* From your project's root directory, run:  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git checkout \-b feature/step-2.2a-foundation-hardening  
 \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.2: Install New Dependency for Nested RLS\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Install the third-party library required to fix the nested query data leak.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* Navigate to the \`backend\` directory and run:

    \`\`\`

\*\*Part C: Application Security Hardening\*\*

\*\*Step 3.6: Fix Stale User Context (\`SEC-003\`)\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Refactor the \`JwtStrategy\` to perform a "freshness check" against the database after validating a token.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Replace the entire content of the file with this hardened version, which injects \`PrismaService\` and checks the user's status.

        });  
      }  
    \`\`\`  
    \*Note: We are consciously choosing not to add the transaction-awareness logic here, as it was part of a flawed plan. We will re-implement a superior version in a later step.\*

\*\*4. Final Validation\*\*  
\*   Run the application with \`docker compose up \--build \-d\`.  
\*   Verify that the application starts successfully without any dependency injection errors.  
\*   Perform a manual API test to confirm core functionality remains intact after this significant refactoring.

\#\#\# \*\*Step 2.3 (v2.0) \- Implement Hardened and Performant RLS Policies: Implementation Instructions\*\*

\*\*1. Goal\*\*  
To implement the definitive, synthesized set of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies. This will serve as our critical "defense-in-depth" security layer, incorporating the security hardening and performance optimizations identified during our "Validate-After" review phase.

\*\*2. Prerequisites\*\*  
\*   The project is in the state following the successful completion and merge of Step 2.2a (Foundation Hardening).  
\*   Your local \`feature/mhe-mt-v6\` branch is up-to-date with all previous merges.  
\*   The Supabase local development stack is running (\`npx supabase start\`).

\*\*3. Implementation Steps\*\*

\*\*Part A: Create the Hardened RLS Policy SQL Script\*\*

\*\*Step 3.1: Create the New Feature Branch\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Before making any changes, create and switch to a new feature branch for this step.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* From your project's root directory, run:  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git checkout \-b feature/step-2.3-rls-policies-v2  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.2: Create the \`rls\_policies.sql\` File\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a new file in the \`backend/prisma\` directory. This file will be our single source of truth for all database security policies.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/prisma/rls\_policies.sql  
    \`\`\`  
    Paste the following complete, idempotent, and hardened SQL script into the file. This script is a synthesis of the best patterns from our expert reviews.

\---  
\`\`\`sql  
\-- \=================================================================  
\-- RLS Policies for MHE-MT v6 (v2.0 \- Hardened & Performant)  
\-- \=================================================================  
\-- This script is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely.

\-- Step 1: Create a dedicated schema for RLS helper functions  
\-- \-----------------------------------------------------------------  
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS rls;

\-- Step 2: Create a hardened, performant helper function for the admin check  
\-- This STABLE function allows its result to be cached for the duration of a query.  
\-- The secure search\_path prevents search\_path hijacking vulnerabilities.  
\-- \-----------------------------------------------------------------  
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rls.is\_current\_user\_admin()  
RETURNS boolean  
LANGUAGE plpgsql  
STABLE  
SECURITY INVOKER  
SET search\_path \= public, pg\_temp  
AS $$  
BEGIN  
  RETURN EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1  
    FROM public."Membership" m  
    JOIN public."MembershipRole" mr ON m.id \= mr."membershipId"  
    JOIN public."Role" r ON mr."roleId" \= r.id  
    WHERE m."userId" \= (SELECT current\_setting('rls.user\_id', true))  
      AND m."organizationId" \= (SELECT current\_setting('rls.organization\_id', true))  
      AND r.name \= 'Admin'  
  );  
END;  
$$;

\-- Step 3: Enable RLS on all relevant tables  
\-- This ensures a "deny by default" security posture.  
\-- \-----------------------------------------------------------------  
ALTER TABLE public."Organization" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."User" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Membership" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Role" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."MembershipRole" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Permission" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."RolePermission" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Habit" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

\-- Step 4: Force RLS for Table Owners  
\-- This is a critical security step to ensure the application's own database  
\-- role cannot bypass the policies.  
\-- \-----------------------------------------------------------------  
ALTER TABLE public."Organization" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."User" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Membership" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Role" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."MembershipRole" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Permission" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."RolePermission" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
ALTER TABLE public."Habit" FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

\-- Step 5: Define Policies for each Table  
\-- Policies use the direct (SELECT current\_setting(...)) pattern for performance.  
\-- \-----------------------------------------------------------------

  FOR INSERT

\-- \=== Role Policies (Hardened) \===  
\-- SELECT is permissive, but write operations are strictly limited.  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "role\_select\_policy" ON public."Role";  
CREATE POLICY "role\_select\_policy" ON public."Role"  
  FOR SELECT  
  USING ( "organizationId" IS NULL OR "organizationId" \= (SELECT current\_setting('rls.organization\_id', true)) );

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "role\_write\_policy" ON public."Role";

\-- \=== Permission Policies \===  
\-- Public read-only for the application role.  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "permission\_select\_policy" ON public."Permission";  
CREATE POLICY "permission\_select\_policy" ON public."Permission"

\*\*Part B: Integrate SQL Script with Prisma Migrate\*\*

\*\*Step 3.3: Integrate the SQL Script into a New Migration\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* We will now generate a new migration file and embed our RLS policies within it.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  First, ensure you are in the \`backend\` directory.  
    2\.  Run the following Prisma command to generate a new, empty migration folder:  
        \`\`\`bash  
        npx prisma migrate dev \--create-only \--name "add-hardened-rls-policies-v2"  
        \`\`\`  
    3\.  This command will create a new directory inside \`backend/prisma/migrations/\`. Open the \`migration.sql\` file within that new directory.  
    4\.  \*\*Copy the entire content\*\* of the \`backend/prisma/rls\_policies.sql\` file you just created and \*\*paste it at the end\*\* of this new \`migration.sql\` file.

\*\*Part C: Apply and Validate the Migration\*\*

\*\*Step 3.4: Apply the Migration\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Apply our new migration, which now includes the RLS policies, to the local database.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  Make sure you are in the \`backend\` directory.  
    2\.  Run the \`migrate dev\` command with the \`DATABASE\_URL\` override. You can skip adding a name since we already created the file; just press Enter when prompted.  
        \`\`\`bash

\*\*Step 3.5: Manual Smoke Test\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Perform a quick manual validation to confirm the RLS policies are active and working as expected.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  Connect to your local Supabase database using the \*\*SQL Editor\*\* in Supabase Studio.  
    2\.  Run queries to get the \`id\` for an organization and a user within that organization.  
    3\.  In the SQL Editor, run the following commands one by one, replacing the placeholder IDs with the actual IDs from your database.  
        \`\`\`sql  
        \-- Step 1: Simulate the context for your user in your organization  
        SET LOCAL rls.organization\_id \= 'your\_org\_id\_here';  
        SET LOCAL rls.user\_id \= 'your\_user\_id\_here';

        \-- Step 2: Try to create a GLOBAL role. This should FAIL due to the hardened write policy.  
        INSERT INTO public."Role" (id, name, "organizationId")  
        VALUES ('test-global-role-fail', 'Malicious Global Role', NULL);  
        \-- EXPECTED: Error "new row violates row-level security policy for table "Role""  
          
        \-- Step 3: Try to create a habit in the WRONG organization. This should FAIL.  
        INSERT INTO public."Habit" (id, title, "organizationId")   
        VALUES ('test-habit-fail', 'Hacking Attempt', 'a\_different\_org\_id\_here');  
        \-- EXPECTED: RLS violation error here as well.  
        \`\`\`  
    4\.  Verify that both \`INSERT\` queries fail with an RLS violation error.

\*\*4. Documentation Update\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create or update an internal project document (e.g., in a \`docs/\` folder) with the following RLS Policy Matrix for future reference.  
\*   \*\*Content:\*\*  
    \`\`\`markdown  
    \#\# RLS Policy Matrix (v2.0)

A visually correct script can contain subtle syntax errors (like multi-command \`FOR\` clauses) that only a true database parser can identify.\\n4.  \*\*Explicit is Better Than Implicit:\*\* The process of debugging and resolving issues was most effective when using simple, explicit commands (\`gedit\`, \`docker stop \<id\>\`) rather than complex, programmatic ones (\`tee\`, \`ls | head\`).\\n5.  \*\*Raw SQL vs. ORM:\*\* When writing raw SQL, do not assume ORM-level conveniences (like automatic timestamps) will be present.

\#\#\# \*\*Step 3.1 (v2.0) \- Implement and Test Secure, Tenant-Aware Async Jobs: Implementation Instructions\*\*

\*\*1. Goal\*\*  
To implement and test a complete, secure, and tenant-aware asynchronous job using BullMQ, proving that tenant context (\`userId\` and \`organizationId\`) is correctly and securely propagated from an API request to a background worker. This implementation will include critical security hardening for the job payload.

\*\*2. Prerequisites\*\*  
\*   The project is in the state following the successful merge of Step 2.3 (Hardened RLS Policies).  
\*   Your local \`feature/mhe-mt-v6\` branch is up-to-date.  
\*   The Supabase local development stack is running (\`npx supabase start\`).

\*\*3. Implementation Steps\*\*

\*\*Part A: Create Feature Branch and Implement Payload Security\*\*

\*\*Step 3.1: Create the New Feature Branch\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Before making any changes, create and switch to a new feature branch.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\* From your project's root directory, run:  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git checkout \-b feature/step-3.1-secure-async-jobs  
    \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.2: Create the \`EncryptionService\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create a new service in the \`core\` module responsible for encrypting and decrypting our job payloads. This is a critical security measure.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  Create the new service file:  
        \`\`\`bash  
        gedit backend/src/core/encryption.service.ts  
        \`\`\`  
    2\.  Paste the following content. This service uses Node.js's built-in \`crypto\` library to perform AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption.  
        \`\`\`typescript  
        import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';  
        import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';  
        import \* as crypto from 'crypto';

        @Injectable()  
        export class EncryptionService {  
          private readonly key: Buffer;  
          private readonly ivLength \= 16;  
          private readonly authTagLength \= 16;  
          private readonly algorithm \= 'aes-256-gcm';

          constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {  
            const encryptionKey \= this.configService.get\<string\>('ENCRYPTION\_KEY');  
            if (\!encryptionKey || encryptionKey.length \!== 32\) {  
              throw new Error('ENCRYPTION\_KEY must be a 32-character string.');  
            }  
            this.key \= Buffer.from(encryptionKey, 'utf-8');  
          }

          encrypt(text: string): string {  
            const iv \= crypto.randomBytes(this.ivLength);  
            const cipher \= crypto.createCipheriv(this.algorithm, this.key, iv);  
            const encrypted \= Buffer.concat(\[cipher.update(text, 'utf8'), cipher.final()\]);  
            const authTag \= cipher.getAuthTag();  
            return Buffer.concat(\[iv, authTag, encrypted\]).toString('hex');  
          }

          decrypt(encryptedText: string): string {  
            const buffer \= Buffer.from(encryptedText, 'hex');  
            const iv \= buffer.subarray(0, this.ivLength);  
            const authTag \= buffer.subarray(this.ivLength, this.ivLength \+ this.authTagLength);  
            const encrypted \= buffer.subarray(this.ivLength \+ this.authTagLength);  
            const decipher \= crypto.createDecipheriv(this.algorithm, this.key, iv);  
            decipher.setAuthTag(authTag);  
            const decrypted \= Buffer.concat(\[decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8'), decipher.final('utf8')\]);  
            return decrypted.toString();  
          }  
        }  
        \`\`\`  
    3\.  Add \`ENCRYPTION\_KEY\` to your \`.env\` file. It \*\*must be 32 characters long\*\*.  
        \`\`\`bash  
        gedit backend/.env  
        \`\`\`  
        Add this line (you can replace the value with any other 32-character string):  
        \`\`\`  
        ENCRYPTION\_KEY=this-is-a-super-secret-key-123\!  
        \`\`\`  
    4\.  Update \`backend/src/core/core.module.ts\` to provide this new service.  
        \`\`\`bash  
        gedit backend/src/core/core.module.ts  
        \`\`\`  
        Add \`EncryptionService\` to the \`providers\` and \`exports\` arrays:  
        \`\`\`typescript  
        import { Global, Module } from '@nestjs/common';  
        import { ContextService } from './context.service';  
        import { EncryptionService } from './encryption.service';

        @Global()  
        @Module({  
          providers: \[ContextService, EncryptionService\],  
          exports: \[ContextService, EncryptionService\],  
        })  
        export class CoreModule {}  
        \`\`\`

\*\*Step 3.3: Define Job Contracts & Queues\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create constants for queue names and a type-safe DTO class for the job payload.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  Create the constants file:  
        \`\`\`bash  
        mkdir \-p backend/src/async-tasks  
        gedit backend/src/async-tasks/async-tasks.constants.ts  
        \`\`\`  
        Paste this content:  
        \`\`\`typescript  
        export const HABIT\_CREATION\_QUEUE \= 'habit-creation';  
        export const CREATE\_HABIT\_JOB \= 'create-habit-job';  
        \`\`\`  
    2\.  Create the DTO file. This will now be a \`class\` to support runtime validation.  
        \`\`\`bash  
        mkdir \-p backend/src/async-tasks/dto  
        gedit backend/src/async-tasks/dto/create-habit-job.dto.ts  
        \`\`\`  
        Paste this content:  
        \`\`\`typescript  
        import { Type } from 'class-transformer';  
        import { IsNotEmpty, IsString, IsUUID, ValidateNested } from 'class-validator';

        class JobContextDto {  
          @IsUUID()  
          @IsNotEmpty()  
          organizationId: string;

          @IsUUID()  
          @IsNotEmpty()  
          userId: string;  
            
          @IsString()  
          requestId?: string;  
        }

        class JobDataDto {  
          @IsString()  
          @IsNotEmpty()  
          title: string;  
        }

        export class CreateHabitJobPayload {  
          @ValidateNested()  
          @Type(() \=\> JobContextDto)  
          context: JobContextDto;  
            
          @ValidateNested()  
          @Type(() \=\> JobDataDto)  
          data: JobDataDto;  
        }  
        \`\`\`

\*\*Part B: Implement the Job Producer (API Layer)\*\*

\*\*Step 3.4: Create the \`AsyncTasks\` Module, Controller, and Service\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create the files for our new feature.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    1\.  Create the service file. It will now inject the \`EncryptionService\`.  
        \`\`\`bash  
        gedit backend/src/async-tasks/async-tasks.service.ts  
        \`\`\`  
        Paste this content:  
        \`\`\`typescript  
        import { Injectable, InternalServerErrorException } from '@nestjs/common';  
        import { InjectQueue } from '@nestjs/bullmq';  
        import { Queue, Job } from 'bullmq';  
        import { ClsService } from 'nestjs-cls';

\*\*Part C: Implement the Secure Job Consumer (Worker Layer)\*\*

\*\*Step 3.5: Create the Secure Tenant-Aware Worker\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Create the BullMQ worker that will decrypt, validate, and then process the jobs.

        const rawPayload \= JSON.parse(decryptedPayload);

        const payloadInstance \= plainToInstance(CreateHabitJobPayload, rawPayload);  
        const errors \= await validate(payloadInstance);

          throw new Error('Invalid job payload.'); // Will not be retried if error is permanent  
        }

        // Step 3: Re-establish context using the validated payload  
        const { context, data } \= payloadInstance;  
        this.cls.set('organizationId', context.organizationId);  
        this.cls.set('userId', context.userId);

        // Step 4: Process the job  
        if (job.name \=== CREATE\_HABIT\_JOB) {

      }  
    }  
    \`\`\`  
    \*Note: For the worker, we are using a more imperative \`this.cls.set()\` inside the method, which is functionally equivalent to the \`@UseCls\` setup function and sometimes clearer when complex pre-processing like decryption and validation is required.\*

\*\*Part D: Integrate and Finalize\*\*

\*\*Step 3.6: Import \`AsyncTasksModule\` into \`AppModule\`\*\*  
\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Add our new module to the main application module.  
\*   \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    gedit backend/src/app.module.ts  
    \`\`\`  
    Add \`AsyncTasksModule\` to the \`imports\` array:  
    \`\`\`typescript  
    // ...  
    import { AsyncTasksModule } from './async-tasks/async-tasks.module';

    @Module({  
      imports: \[  
        // ... all other modules  
        McModule,  
        AsyncTasksModule, // \<-- ADD THIS LINE  
      \],  
      //...  
    })  
    export class AppModule {}  
    \`\`\`  
\*   \*\*After updating all files, please let me know.\*\* This completes the implementation, and we can move to final validation.
